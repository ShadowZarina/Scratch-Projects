# Scratch-Projects
This repository features my original games which were created in the official Scratch website, including:
- Eco Serpents

## How to Run the Games?
1. Download the game's respective ZIP file.
2. Extract the Zip file:
   - Windows: Right-click the zipped folder, select "Extract All...", choose a destination folder (e.g., your Desktop or Downloads folder), and click "Extract".
   - Mac: Double-click the zipped file. The files will be automatically extracted into a new folder in the same location.
3. Locate the project file: Inside the extracted folder, find the main Scratch project file, which will end in .sb3.
4. Upload to the Scratch Editor:
   - Go to the Scratch website and click "Create" or open the Scratch offline editor.
   - In the editor, click on the "File" menu at the top.
   - Select "Upload from Your Computer".
   - Navigate to the extracted folder, select the .sb3 file, and click "Open" or "Upload".
5. Run the game: The project will load in the editor. Click the green flag icon above the stage area to start the game.
